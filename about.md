About Me  
Hi! My name is Brooklyn Louie, and I am a senior in electrical engineering at UCSD, concentrating in both analog and digital circuits, systems, and signals. This is a blog/portfolio/collection about various projects that I am or have been working on, and I hope that by documenting both my design process as well as final results, that they can be useful or interesting to anyone viewing them.
